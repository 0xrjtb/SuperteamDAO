            We help the most promising projects in the Solana ecosystem in the ascending world (India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa) launch and grow. We are organized as a co-operative of creatives, operators, and investors who are experienced in launching and growing technology businesses.
            We value the sovereignty that comes with founding a company, the skin in the game that comes with investing, and the joy that comes with getting sh*t done. In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into broiler categories â€” founder, investor, or employee. Crypto allows us to be free-range and be all 3 at the same time.
            This workspace is raw, WIP, and meant for our community. We're turning our organization inside-out so you can lurk, find opportunities and join us on this adventure.
